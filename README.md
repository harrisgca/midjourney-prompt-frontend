# README

Originally was going to be a prompt generator for Midjourney AI art generator, but turned into a grab bag of different libs. Keeping this around as a
future reference in case I need this stuff again.

Things to take note of for future reference

- File drag and drop
- Jest config
- Global styles setup
- ESLint rules
- Project setup in general
- Might be some useful stuff in the tests
